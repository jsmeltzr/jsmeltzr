Hello World!

My name is Josh Smeltzer. I have worked for many years in the 3D feature film animation industry as a shading TD, and pipeline developer. 

I enjoy tinkering with graphics applications, and exploring topics in the arts and sciences through code.

I hope to share some of my projects with the community as they mature in the near future.
